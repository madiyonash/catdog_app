# Cat and Dog Image Classification using Neural Networks to Develop a Web App
## Susan Nunez, Claire Robinson, Madison Yonash

# Introduction 

As the project for **CAP 4793 Advanced Data Science** was very open-ended, our team wanted to choose a project that encompasses both something that interests us and something that would challenge us to do something new. Our inspiration came from our furry friends:

If you're a human looking at those photos, you can probably easily tell that one is a cat and one is a (very stylish) dog. But if you have 25,000 photos of cats and dogs, it would take quite a bit of time for a human to **cat**egorize all of them. This is where machine learning comes in. Our team created a convulsional neural network to perform this task. Additionally, we wanted to create an interface in which a user could upload their own photo and have the model classify it. We were very **mew** to both of these tasks, so it provided a great learning opportunity.
